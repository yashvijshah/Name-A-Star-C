# Name-A-Star-C
This program allows people to name pairs of stars in a hypothetical universe by their names.

This project is inspried by the concept of naming wedding or birthday stars by your loved ones' names. In order to do so, run the main.c file and take a screenshot of the final output to get it framed for your memory.
